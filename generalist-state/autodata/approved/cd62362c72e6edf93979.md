| `events.proof_context_overflow_nonfatal` | passed | uncovered | passed | passed |
| `events.proof_verified_after_registration` | passed | uncovered | blocked (The production final loop combines unbounded model iteration, Lean execution, semantic review, persistence, and registration without a bounded route-level seam. Direct registration ordering is covered elsewhere; publishing a full lifecycle pass would require faking the transition owner rather than observing it.) | uncovered |
| `outputs.at_least_one_output_enabled` | passed | passed | uncovered | passed |
| `outputs.papers_only_skips_proof_work` | passed | uncovered | uncovered | uncovered |

| `proof_loop.automatic_round_policy_preserved` | passed | uncovered | passed | uncovered |
| `proof_loop.continuous_explicit_ownership` | passed | uncovered | blocked (Focused manager and driver tests observe no-candidate continuation, detailed round activity, Stop cleanup, and non-resumable state separately; no bounded real adapter currently observes the complete continuous route lifecycle as one interaction.) | uncovered |
| `proof_pruning.artifacts_and_future_memory_preserved` | passed | uncovered | passed | uncovered |
| `proof_pruning.commit_lifecycle_fenced` | passed | uncovered | passed | uncovered |
| `proof_pruning.context_overflow_truthful` | passed | uncovered | blocked (Existing isolated tests observe nonfatal proof overflow and pruning triggers separately; no bounded seam observes an overflow arriving during a prune commit without synthesizing the transition owner.) | uncovered |

| `proof_pruning.occurrence_scope_isolated` | passed | uncovered | passed | uncovered |
| `proof_pruning.owning_run_context_excludes_pruned` | passed | uncovered | passed | uncovered |
| `proof_pruning.review_non_blocking` | passed | uncovered | passed | uncovered |
| `proof_pruning.semantic_distinct_review_preserves_unique_routes` | passed | uncovered | blocked (Focused unit tests cover durable retained-support protection and section arbitration, but no bounded real-coordinator adapter yet observes canonically distinct semantic routes through proposal, validation, commit, and a later support-prune attempt.) | uncovered |
| `proof_pruning.validator_gates_automatic_mutation` | passed | uncovered | passed | uncovered |
| `proof_runtime.candidate_list_validator_gate` | uncovered | uncovered | blocked (Focused stage tests observe exact threshold, approved-only forwarding, scope invalidation, and semantic-memory bounds, but no bounded real-coordinator adapter yet observes Autonomous restart plus manual process-local ownership without synthesizing the lifecycle owner.) | uncovered |

| `provider.pause_preserves_checkpoint` | passed | uncovered | passed | uncovered |
| `provider.reset_wakes_without_corrupting_checkpoint` | passed | uncovered | uncovered | uncovered |
| `provider.stop_resume_preserves_pause` | passed | uncovered | blocked (Existing coordinator coverage observes pause/reset resume, but no bounded test seam independently interleaves user Stop while the provider wait is active.) | uncovered |
| `runtime.child_tasks_count_as_active` | uncovered | passed | uncovered | uncovered |
| `runtime.parent_action_fences_child_outputs` | uncovered | uncovered | blocked (The invariant catalog declares model-only support and no existing isolated production seam exposes stale child output acceptance after parent takeover.) | uncovered |

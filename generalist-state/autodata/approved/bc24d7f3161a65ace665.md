## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Intrafere/MOTO-Autonomous-ASI
   cd MOTO-Autonomous-ASI
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

4. **Set up development environment**:
   - Install [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com/) (recommended for AI-assisted development)
   - The `.cursor/rules/` folder contains complete design specifications
   - Cursor can help you understand and modify the codebase

5. **Create a branch for your work**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
   ```

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

**Python**:
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and modular

**JavaScript/React**:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow JSX best practices
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Project Structure

Understand the three-tier architecture:
- **Tier 1 (Aggregator)**: `backend/aggregator/` - Multi-agent knowledge building
- **Tier 2 (Compiler)**: `backend/compiler/` - Paper compilation and validation
- **Tier 3 (Autonomous)**: `backend/autonomous/` - Autonomous research workflow

Key directories:
- `backend/shared/`: Shared utilities, API clients, models
- `backend/api/`: FastAPI routes and WebSocket
- `frontend/src/components/`: React UI components
- `.cursor/rules/`: Complete system design specifications

### Design Specifications

**CRITICAL**: Before making significant changes, read the relevant design docs in `.cursor/rules/`:

1. **part-1-aggregator-tool-design-specifications.mdc**: Multi-agent aggregation workflow
2. **part-2-compiler-tool-design-specification.mdc**: Paper compilation system
3. **part-3-autonomous-research-mode.mdc**: Autonomous topic selection and synthesis
4. **rag-design-for-overall-program.mdc**: RAG architecture and 4-stage pipeline
5. **program-directory-and-file-definitions.mdc**: File structure and purpose

These specifications are used by AI agents (like Cursor) to assist with development.

## 💡 Proposing Features

### Before Proposing

1. **Check if already proposed** in issues
2. **Review design specs** to understand current architecture
3. **Consider system constraints** (multi-agent coordination, RAG pipeline, etc.)

```markdown
**Is your feature related to a problem?**
Clear description of the problem.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Clear description of desired functionality.

**Describe alternatives considered**
Alternative solutions or features you've considered.

**Architecture impact**
How would this affect:
- Aggregator (Tier 1)?
- Compiler (Tier 2)?
- Autonomous Research (Tier 3)?
- RAG system?
- UI/UX?

**Additional context**
Mockups, examples, or relevant information.
```
